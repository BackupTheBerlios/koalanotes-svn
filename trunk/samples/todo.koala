Need to test that it works by editing a sample file.&#xA;&#xA; - Allow a note to be moved Up/Down/Left/Right.&#xA; - Popup dialog for creation of a note so user can type in the name.&#xA; - Give note creation dialog a way of choosing a parent note (a dropdown for the most likely options plus a Browse button to choose from the tree).&#xA;">
