  <note name="Main" text="&#xA;Currently:&#xA;Working on Action framework.  Just moved from old Listeners to new Listeners and Actions.  Action will be used in all the menu items (and later, the toolbars), to make it easier to keep the enabled/disabled state of the menu items in sync.&#xA;&#xA;Got an interesting ConcurrentModificationException at DisplayedNote.deleteSelfAndChildren() line 1 when I tried to delete a parent node and its child in the same operation.&#xA;&#xA;Next steps:&#xA; - Shortcut keys for use only when the tree is in focus eg. Del to delete a note.&#xA; - Ctrl-Shift-Up/Down/Left/Right shortcuts for moving a note.&#xA; - Cut/Copy/Paste for notes in tree and relevant shortcut keys.&#xA; - Drag-Drop for moving notes in the tree.&#xA; - File-&gt;Exit.&#xA; - Prompt user to save if they exit without saving.&#xA; - Save view of document eg. what tabs were open (not where scrolled to).&#xA; - Toolbar bar.&#xA; - Status bar.&#xA; - Automated tests.&#xA;&#xA;After first release:&#xA; - Dividers for main view.&#xA; - Option to save view of document a) as part of document b) in a nominated file.  Default to option a.&#xA; - Rich text&#xA; - HTML Export&#xA; - Templates!  Eg. Character." />
